              </p>
              <p>
                UN Open GIS is an initiative conceived by the UNGIS Section of
                the Operations Support Division of the Office of Information and
                Communications Technology (OICT) to leverage free and open
                source software resources. The undertaking was first brought to
                the table in September 2015 in Vienna, Austria, mainly to
                establish an open source program for peace operations (Eom,
                2016). The result was the establishment of the UN Open GIS
                Initiative in March 2016 that would harness open source
                technologies through partnership. The UN Open GIS Initiative
                recommends a phased approach in a hybrid model, and these four
                (4) phases (or Working groups) are called “Spirals”.

                  applications to be used for operational requirements specific

              <p>
                As part of the Spiral-2, which aims to build UN capacity for
                utilizing available open source software applications, the
                UNMISS Malakal GIS team was encouraged by their OIC to embark on
                an in-house training using QGIS tools at disposal. The decision
                to dedicate time to learn open source GIS software was not only
                based on the UN Open GIS Initiative, but it also due to the
                licensing constraints from proprietary software and applications
                that field missions face.

                <b>Free and Open Source Software </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) provides flexibility in
                terms of access to source-code and for ease of understanding and
                modification, which in some cases can be either cheap or free as
                in monetary value (Dempsey, 2017). FOSS offers greater access to
                range of services with little restrictions on the users. The
                best part of FOSS is either getting rid of or reducing the
                reliance on proprietary software - the licensing contracts for
                which can be expensive and inflexible. UN Open GIS Initiative
                was conceived to harness the available resources in the Open GIS
                community to not only reduce costs but also to increase
                efficiency and flexibility in service delivery and
                innovation.<br />
                It was against these backdrops that the Malakal GIS team
                embarked on projects that utilize the resources of open source
                GIS software.

              <p>
                QGIS is a free and open source GIS software with powerful tools.
                It was understood that a combination of several FOSS
                applications aided by the open source software with all GIS
                capabilities would yield the desire results. This was how some
                of the product items requested by peacekeepers at UNMISS Sector
                North were produced.
                <br />
                Initially, only the Malakal GIS OIC took the online QGIS course
                offered by Politecnico di Milano, a UN Open GIS partner. Upon
                completing the course in November 2016, all the staff in the
                Malakal field GIS office were encouraged to learn and use the
                software as part of the in-house training facilitated by the
                OIC. The other staff would later, in 2018, take the same course
                while having acquired the basics. Malakal GIS team currently
                operates in open source platform for almost all operational
                needs.

                The samples highlighted in next pages, affirms that there exist
                several benefits of using open source GIS software. Successful
                completion of large-scale works using FOSS, combined with some
                proprietary software in UN GIS will provide a variety of options
                to choose and a safety net for business continuity in case of
                licensing issues.<br />
                All staff are currently fully operating in QGIS as well as in
                proprietary software. Most staff are more confident in using
                QGIS due to the flexibility to accessing a variety of extensions
                (plug-ins) that are freely offered.

                Open source programs are very dynamic in many aspects including
                frequent changes that take so much of the user’s time to adapt.
                Much of the tools and functionalities in QGIS as with most Open
                source programs, are too technical for beginners. This comes
                from the prime objective of the open source, which is geared
                toward programmers and scientists. While this gives them
                flexibility and efficiency, it does the exact opposite to less
                technical and less experienced users, something propriety
                vendors (e.g. ArcGIS) avoid.
