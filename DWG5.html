                The demand for the analytical geospatial information products,
                image analysis and interpretation for monitoring, situational
                awareness, reporting, planning and decision-making processes at
                the United Nations is growing. Thus, the provision of accurate
                and timely satellite imagery, thematic and analytical products
                without applying innovative methods and technology presents
                challenge.
                <br /><br />
                The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly
                prevalent in the field of Computer Vision, and the UN is
                actively seeking ways in which this technology can be leveraged
                for its operations. UN Global Pulse, together with the UN’s GIS
                teams and other UN partners, have been researching and
                developing technical methods of using AI for the processing of
                satellite imagery. This work has been used to map refugee camps
                and automatically derive locations and numbers of dwellings;
                automate the production of flood maps; automate damage and
                events detection over large geographic areas of interest.
